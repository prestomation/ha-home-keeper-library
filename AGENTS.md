# AGENTS.md — Home Keeper Library

Home Keeper Library is a Home Assistant integration (domain `home_keeper_library`) for the
books of a household: rooms, shelves, copies, reading status, loans and a wishlist. It is
a companion of Home Keeper and requires it. This page lists the hard gates. The detail is
in the rules files below. Read the file for your topic before you change code or push.

## Project in brief

- Backend: `custom_components/home_keeper_library/`. The pure core imports no Home
  Assistant code.
- Storage: 1 JSON document, `.storage/home_keeper_library`, changed only through
  `LibraryStore`. Covers are files in `.storage/home_keeper_library_covers/`.
- Home Keeper is an `after_dependencies` entry. The admin UI is the Library tab of the
  Home Keeper panel. Without Home Keeper, a repair issue shows and the tab is gone.
- Frontend: TypeScript and Rollup in `custom_components/home_keeper_library/frontend/`.
  CI builds `frontend/dist/` (`library-tab.js`, `library-card.js`), which is gitignored.
- Administration is in the tab. Usage is through the card, the per-person `sensor` and
  `todo` entities and the open services. Do not mix the 2.
- Docs site: `website/` (Docusaurus). It renders `docs/guide/` and copies some `docs/*.md`.
  Edit the sources, never the generated trees.
- `README.md` lists every automated check in its **Guardrails** table.

## Hard gates

### Writing

- **All English text follows ASD-STE100.** Docs, strings, comments, PR text and chat
  replies. Read [writing-style.md](.amazonq/rules/writing-style.md) before you write prose.

### Branches and merges

- **Never push to `main`.** Use a feature branch and a PR.
- **Every check green, plus approval, before a merge.** A failure you did not cause is
  still yours to clear. Never merge on a red or running check.
- **Read what a soft gate produced.** A `continue-on-error` step is always green.
- **Always squash merge.**
- **Run the tests locally before you push.** Never use CI as the test runner.
  Pure unit tests: `pip install pytest PyYAML hypothesis`, then `pytest tests/unit`. Run
  the component tier, `npx vitest run` and `mypy` too
  ([testing.md](.amazonq/rules/testing.md)). The component tier and the Docker tier
  never share a pytest run.
- **Ask Amazon Q for a review after each push.** Post `/q review {request}` and ask for
  critical feedback on named topics. Triage what comes back.
- **Never comment on a GitHub issue.** Findings go in the PR. Link the issue with
  `Fixes #N`; the release closes it. The 1 exception is the `preview-comment` skill, after
  the maintainer approves the exact text.

### Plans and PR bodies

- **A plan lives in the PR body.** It starts with the CHANGELOG bullet it will ship.
- **List one-way doors.** The plan and the PR body name every external contract the
  change commits to: service fields, event payloads, storage, attributes, user-data keys.
- **Add a Security section.** The plan and the PR body say if each service, websocket
  command, HTTP method and event that the change adds or changes is admin-only or open,
  and why ([architecture.md](.amazonq/rules/architecture.md#how-to-decide)).
- **A subjective UI choice starts with an artifact.** Mock up the options at desktop and
  phone width, then agree on 1.

### UI evidence

- **A PR that touches `frontend/src/` embeds screenshots: desktop and phone.** Every
  changed surface needs both. Capture with the Playwright harness, read each PNG, commit
  under `docs/images/`, and embed with a SHA-pinned HTML `<img>`. The phone step goes in
  the `setViewportSize(PHONE)` block with a `-mobile` name. A new surface also gets an
  assertion in `tests/e2e/tests/`.
- **A new UI feature extends the walkthrough tour** (`tests/e2e/walkthrough.capture.ts`)
  in the same PR. CI records it and posts it as a PR comment. Never commit a video.
  Capture is a hard gate.
- **A new major feature is documented in `docs/guide/`** in the same change, with
  screenshots. `README.md` stays short.

### Mutation gate

- **`mutation.yml` fails a PR below an 80% mutation score on the code it changed.** Kill
  a surviving mutant with a real assertion, or mark a truly equivalent one with a reason.
  Never lower the threshold. The allowlist is `only_mutate` in `pyproject.toml` and
  `mutate` in `stryker.conf.json`.

### CHANGELOG and versions

- **Each user-facing change gets 1 bullet of at most 3 sentences**, the lead included.
- **The bold lead is a 2 to 5 word noun phrase**, with no articles. An `### Added` lead
  links its guide page by absolute URL: `**[Text](url).**`.
- **The bullet says what a user gets.** No mechanism, no inventory.
- **`(Fixes #N)` goes in the bullet's first paragraph.** It is what notifies and closes
  the issue. A bare `(#N)` does nothing.
- **Credit an outside contributor** with `(Thanks @user!)`.
- **Never add an entry to a section whose version is already tagged.** Bump the version.
- **A stable section covers everything since the last stable**, with a `### Fixed` list
  of every `(Fixes #N)` since then.
- **Betas use the next release number.** After `X.Y.0` ships, `main` goes to
  `X.(Y+1).0b1`. Never cut `X.Y.0bN` after `X.Y.0`.
- **A new feature cuts a beta in the same PR.** Bump `manifest.json` and `PANEL_VERSION`
  to the next `bN`, or fold into the top beta if it is still unreleased.
- **Label a new-feature PR `preview-release`** as soon as it is open.

### Code contracts

- **Every data action is a `home_keeper_library.*` service.** A websocket command never
  replaces it ([services-and-events.md](.amazonq/rules/services-and-events.md)).
- **Gate an admin-only operation for the service and its websocket twin**, through
  `services.async_run` ([architecture.md](.amazonq/rules/architecture.md#privilege-model)).
- **A reply never leaks.** Every read goes through `projections.py`. Test it as an admin
  and as a non-admin user.
- **Never raise `ConfigEntryNotReady` for Home Keeper.** Show the repair issue.
- **Every state change fires a `home_keeper_library_<noun>_<verb>` event** from the store.
- **Every integrator surface is declared in `api_surface.py`.**
- **An options flow returns `config_flow.merge_flow_input(...)`**, never `user_input`
  ([architecture.md](.amazonq/rules/architecture.md#options)).
- **Every user-facing exception has a `translation_key`.**
- Escape all user content with `escapeHTML`. Navigate the tab only with `host.navigate`.
- All datetimes are timezone-aware. Pure code takes the time from its caller.
- **A job that installs Home Assistant runs at or above HA's Python floor** and runs
  `ci/check-ha-version.py`.

### Dev docs

- **Before you change code, run `python3 ci/docs.py for <path>`.** It prints the design
  docs and goals for that file. `list`, `read`, `outline` and `search` find the rest.
- **On design-doc drift, check the goals.** If the change works against a goal, stop and
  ask the user. Else make the doc describe the code as it is now, with no history, and
  run `python3 ci/docs.py stamp <id>`.
- **A change to Goals or Non-goals needs a "Goal changes" PR section** that the
  maintainer agreed to.
- **Each new source file under `custom_components/home_keeper_library/` goes in exactly 1
  design doc's `implements`.**
- **Caps**: design 150 lines, reference 300, rules 200, process 200, backlog 300, skill
  200; 100 characters a line; `CLAUDE.md` plus this file 250. At most 2 length exceptions.
- **Unbuilt work goes in `IDEAS.md`.** There are no plan files.
- `docs-audit` in `lint.yml` runs `python3 ci/docs.py check --base origin/main`. Details:
  [dev-docs.md](.amazonq/rules/dev-docs.md).

### Keep the rules current

- **A new or changed convention updates `.amazonq/rules/` in the same change**, and this
  file if it is a hard gate. Keep each fact in 1 place.
