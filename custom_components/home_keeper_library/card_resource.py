"""Pure decision logic for the Lovelace resource of the library card.

This is a copy of ``card_resource.py`` of Home Keeper, which met the same problem
first (Home Keeper #368). No Home Assistant imports: this is the "what should
change" half of the resource registration in ``card.py``, so it runs in the unit
tier. ``card.py`` owns the "how": the calls to the ``ResourceStorageCollection``
of Lovelace.

The asymmetry this module exists to encapsulate: Lovelace's create and update
payloads name the resource type ``res_type``, but
``ResourceStorageCollection._process_create_data`` renames it on the way in, so
*stored* items carry ``type``. Read ``type``; write ``res_type``. Getting that
backwards matches nothing and quietly creates a duplicate on every restart.

    Ignoring scheme and host is deliberate: someone who hand-registered an absolute

    Home Assistant, rather than leaving a host-pinned entry beside ours. A copy
